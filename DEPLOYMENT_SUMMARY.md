**Note:** Repository contains both root-level files (from original remote) and organized magicsite/ directory (from our work). This is intentional and preserves both versions.

## Next Steps for Deployment

### For Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages):

1. **Use magicsite/ directory as root:**
   ```bash
   # In hosting configuration, set build directory to:
   magicsite/
   ```

2. **Configure custom domain** (if applicable)

3. **Set up CI/CD** for automatic deployments

4. **Enable HTTPS** (most hosts do this automatically)

### For Traditional Web Hosting:

1. **Upload magicsite/ contents to web root:**
   - Upload all files from magicsite/ to public_html/ or www/
   - Maintain directory structure

2. **Update asset paths** if needed (currently relative)

3. **Configure .htaccess** for pretty URLs (optional)

4. **Test all links and images**

### For WordPress/CMS Integration:

1. **Use HTML as template basis**
2. **Convert to theme structure**
3. **Integrate with CMS backend**
4. **Set up dynamic content areas**

## Performance Metrics (Expected)

Based on implemented optimizations:

### Lighthouse Scores (Estimated)
- **Performance:** 85-95
- **Accessibility:** 90-95
- **Best Practices:** 90-95
- **SEO:** 95-100

### Core Web Vitals
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** <2.5s (with lazy loading)
- **First Input Delay (FID):** <100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** <0.1 (width/height attributes added)

### File Size Optimizations
- **Lazy loading:** Only visible images load initially
- **Responsive images:** Appropriate sizes per device
- **WebP support:** 30-40% smaller than JPG (when converted)

---

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Regular Updates
1. **Add missing assets** as they become available
2. **Convert images to WebP** for file size savings
3. **Update social media links** when profiles are active
4. **Monitor Lighthouse scores** monthly
5. **Update content** as awards/shows are added

### Git Workflow for Future Updates

# Make changes to files
git add [changed-files]
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```
